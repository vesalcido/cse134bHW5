                <dt><abbr title="Some Fun Facts About Me">Being a Women in STEM</abbr></dt>
                <dd>- Being a women in stem has definitely brought some different experiences such as lots of resources being pointed towards men, not seeing that many women in your own classes, and having a hardtime breaking into the tech industry. Even though these problems range differently from person to person, I'm making it my mission to continue to help others continue having a voice and help eachother out chase after their tech dreams no matter what!</dd>
                <dt>Life outside of Computer Science</dt>
                <dd>- Eventhough computer science takes up a big chunk of my life, I do really enjoy going out with friends, scrolling a lot on TikTok, and overall wind down with some great people in my life that share the same humor as me!</dd>
