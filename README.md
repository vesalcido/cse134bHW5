In this final update of my website portfolio, I improved the overall styling and usability of my website. I refined the padding of the dark mode/light mode toggle across all pages to ensure a consistent layout. My home page now includes a more descriptive introduction, and I removed unnecessary elements that no longer aligned with my vision. I also added buttons linking to my LinkedIn and GitHub for better accessibility. Additionally, I introduced footers on every page, enhanced the dark mode styling to match the light mode aesthetics, and styled the Load Local and Load Remote buttons on my project's page for a more cohesive look. Finally, I centered my resume on the resume page to make it visually appealing and easy for visitors to view. These changes overall left me satisfied with the final look of my website!
